# FitnessBuddy

[My Notes](notes.md)

The FitnessBuddy application is a fitness tracking app that also allows for users to connect with their friends. As users log new workouts they've completed, the app updates a leaderboard that shows the users who have spent the most time working out. There is also a small weather feature that allows for users to see what the conditions are if they want to do an outdoor workout.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [X] Proper use of Markdown
- [X] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [X] Description of key features
- [X] Description of how you will use each technology
- [X] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Do you need a little extra push to meet your fitness goals? With the FitnessBuddy app, you can create challenges and log your workouts to see the progress you make along the way. You can even compete in exercise challenges with your friends in real time to see who is the best!

#### Leaderboard

#### Sequence Diagram
The diagram below shows the basic flow of how a user logs a workout. The user enters workout details in the frontend, which are then sent to the backend service. The backend saves the workout in the database and returns a confirmation, allowing the frontend to update the userâ€™s dashboard with the new data.

    BE -->> FE: Workout saved

```
